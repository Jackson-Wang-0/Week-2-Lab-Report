### Let's begin the Tutorial !!!
# Visual Studio Code

# Remotely Connecting

- Window users need to [install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)to connect your computer to another computer.

Next, each student have their own course-specific account which can be found at: [account lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

_Note: for CSE15L, our account starts with **cs15lwi22**_

Enter the following command but replace `zz` with the letters of your course-specific account 

```
ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jackson-Wang-0/Week-2-Lab-Report/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jackson-Wang-0/Week-2-Lab-Report/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
